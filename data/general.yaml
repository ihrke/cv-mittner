intro: | 
  I am a professor at the UiT - The arctic university of Norway in Tromsø and at the 
  Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim. My main interests within 
  the field of cognitive neuroscience are mind wandering, non-invasive brain
  stimulation, decision making, pupillometry and selective attention. I am also
  interested in the development of methodological approaches in my field and
  enjoy computational methods, cognitive modeling, machine-learning and Bayesian
  statistics.
